# Python, Pandas, and SQL

### Short Description

This workshop provides an overview of how to use Python, Pandas, and SQL to analyze data. It's aimed at programmers, analysts,
and data scientists who work with relational data stored in sql databases, csv files, and excel worksheets. 

### Long Description

SQL, Python, and Pandas are tools that can be used to parse, analyze, reformat, and generate insight into data. SQL is a particularly powerful declarative language that is very effective at querying and subsetting data from multiple tables with common colums. Pandas provides an extensive set of tools for building, sorting, subsetting, joining, and analyzing data in tabular format. Python provides all the flexibility of a full programming language, giving a programmer the ability to break apart and reassemble data with very few restrictions. 

Some tasks are most effectively approached with SQL, some are easier with Pandas dataframes, and some require using custom methods and user defined functions (often through a list-loop-conditional approach). Which tool to use may be a matter of personal preference and skill or comfort level. 

Instead of picking a single technolgoy that provies the "best" approach, it may be much more effective to approach a dataset by bringing in a combination of SQL statements, Pandas daframe operations, and user defined methods and programming constructs in Python.

This tutorial will consist of a series of notebooks and tutorial exercises. Rather than discussing SQL, Pandas, and Python methods in the abstract, participants will use SQL, Pandas, and Dataframes on a SQLite database and a set of CSV files to:

1. Connect directly to a SQLite, parse results as tuples, and read results directly into a pandas dataframe

2. Load CSV files directly into a pandas dataframe, and use Pandas set operations such as merge to join tables on a common colum

3.
